# liri-node-app

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will display your latest tweets, will show spotify song information, output movie information, and use the fs Node package to grab text from inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
